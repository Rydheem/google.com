<P><b>HTML</b> stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language.It is a Computer language used to create web documets,
which contain information in the form and images, called web pages. You can add links to your web pages.
Hperlinks are the highlighted text segments or images that connects a web page to other pages on the web.
Every webpage on the internet is written by using the HTML code. The website containing these web pages can
be veiwed by anyone connected to the Internet. HTML codes ensure the proper formatting of text and images to
be dissplayed by the Internet Browser as per the need of the user.</P>
<P>
Let us analyse the word HTML.
<UL Type="SQUARE"><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="RED"><B><U><LI>HYPER TEXT</FONT></B></U>: Hyper Text is the text used to 
link various web pages.It is the text on a web page, clicking on which opens a new page.
<LI><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="RED"><B><U>Mark-up </FONT></B></U>: It means highlighting the text either by underling
or displaying it in different colours, or Both.
<LI><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="RED"><B><U>LANGUAGE </FONT></B></U>: It refers to the mode of communication between 
web pages. HTML has its own syntax and rules.</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="AQUA"><b><I><U>HTML TAGS</b></i></u></FONT>
<p>HTML is a Tag based language. A Tag is a piece of code, which acts as a label that a web brouser interprets.
It instructs a web brouser what to display. A complete tag having an opening <tag> and a closing </tag> is 
known as element.There are various attributes associated with the tags wich we can use to give different formatting
effects, allingments, colours, etc. to our web pages.
<P><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="AQUA"><b><I><U>STRUCTURE OF AN HTML DOCUMENT</B></I></U></FONT>
<p>The Standard structure of an HTML document has two sections:Head and Body.
<p><UL TYPE="SQUARE"><LI> The <B>HTML</B> document starts with < HTML> tag and ends with < /HTML> tag. Each documents
is considered to be a single page.Everything is written within these tags. If the commands are not enclosed in tags,
then a web browser will assume the commands as simple text. The HTML page is divided into two sections:HEADER 
< HEAD> and BODY< BODY> and there will be no space between the tag and the bracets.
<p><LI>The <b>< HEAD></B> is the first element contained inside the <b>< HTML></B> element. It contains no text within
itself. The Header is where you put information that is important about the web page, but you cannot see it in the
browser window.
<p><LI>The <b>< Title></B> tag has to be given within the <b>< HEAD></B> tags.It contains the title of the document.
The title should be short and less than 64 characters. The <B>< Title></B> tag displays the text that aooears on the
top of the browser, but not in the actual viewing pane.
<p><li>The <b>< BODY></B> tag contains the text, which gets displayed on the web page along with other tags and attributes.
In the < body> tag, we use formatting elements, Images, heading, list,etc; to enhance the appeareance of a web page.</UL>
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="red"><b><u>NOTE</B></U></font><UL TYPE="SQUARE">
<LI>Every opening tag must have an ending tag. The closing tag has a forward slash(/).
However, some tags have only an opening tag.</ul>
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="AQUA"><B><I><U>TYPES OF HTML TAGS</b></i></u></font>
<p>A tag comprises of text enclosed in angle brackets < >. All tags have their own attributes and default values.Each
tag in HTML follows specific rules known as <b> Syntax</B>.These tags are not case sensitive. For Example, < tagname>
and < TAGNAME> will have the same effect. There are infinite combination of HTML tags/elements, which are used for 
forms,images, and lists. Everything displayed on the web page requires the use of the tag. Tags define the structure while
browsers determine the appeareance. The HTML elements can be categorised as: 
<P><UL TYPE="SQUARE"><LI><B>CONTAINER ELEMENTS</B> <LI><B>EMPTY ELEMENTS </UL></B>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="#Ff0000"><B>CONTAINER ELEMENTS</B></FONT>
<P>In HTML, the tag that include both ON and OFF tags are called Container Elements. These tags need both an opening tag< >
and the closing tag </>.The only difference between an opening tag and closing tag is the forward slash'/'.
<p>For Example,< HTML>tag has its closing tag, which is < /HTML>.While using tag sets as container, we should always balance 
the flow.
<p>	<FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="#Ff0000"><B>EMPTY ELEMENTS</b></FONT>
<p><b>Empty elements contain only ON tags,they do not have OFF tags.</b>These elements do not enclose any data.Instead they
function on their own,for example,< br>tag is an empty tag which breaks the line and displays the text from the next line.
You will learn more about < br> tag later.
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="AQUA"><B><I><U>HOW TO CREATE AN HTML DOCUMENT?</b></I></u></font>
<p>To create an HTML document,you can type the text in any word processor, like <B> Writer,gedit</b>.The extendion given to
the page is always.<b>html</b>.Let us see how open and create an HTML document using gedit.
<p><UL TYPE="SQUARE"><LI>Click on the <B>Dash </B>icon and type gedit. The <b>Text Editor</B> icon appears. Click on the icon
to open gedit window.
<LI>Type the HTML as code.
<LI>Click on the <B>File</B> menu and select the <b>Save</B> option.The <B> Save As</B> dialog box will appear.Select the 
folder to save the file. Mention the name in the <b>Name:</b> text box with an extension<b>.html</b>.Click on the <b> Save</B>
button. </UL>
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="AQUA"><B><I><U>VIEWING AN HTML DOCUMET</B></I></U></FONT>
<P>To view an HTML file,we need a web browser,such as Google,Chrome,Mozila Firefox,Internet Explorer or Netscape Navegator.
Here we are using Mozila Firefox.To view your first web page,follow these steps:
<P><UL type="square"><LI>Click on the <B> Firefox Web Browser</b>icon  located on the launcher to open the browser.
<LI>Click on the <P>File</p>menu in Mozila Firefox window and select the <b>Open file</b>option.The <b>Open file </b> dialog 
box will appear.
<LI>Choose the location where you have stored your HTML document.selectyour file and click on the <b>Open</b>button.
<LI>Your web page will be shown on the web browser.</UL>
<P>You can observe that the text given within the < title> tags is displayed on the title bar of the Mozila Firefox window,and 
the text given within the  < body> tags is displayed in the body of the web browser window.Notice the Address bar of the Mozila 
Firefox.The complete path of the Filename with an extenion".html"is displayed in it.You can also type the path in the address
bar,instead of choosing it from the <B>Open file</b>dialog box.
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="AQUA"><B><I><U>ATTRIBUTES</B></I></U></FONT>
<p>HTML elements can have attributes.An attributes is a property that provides additional information about an HTML element.Attributes
are always specified in the opening tag.All attributes consist of two parts:a name and a value,seperated by"=".The name is the property
you want to set, and the value is what you want for the respective property.It is always put within quatation marks.
<p>For Example:<b>< FONT SIZE="4",COLOR="BLUE"></b>.Here font size and color is the attributes of the < font> tag.
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="red"><b><u>NOTE</b></u></font>:- Names and values of the attributes are case sensitive.
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="AQUA"><B><I><U>TYPES OF ELEMENTS</B></I></U></FONT>
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="RED"><B>CONTAINER ELEMENTS</B></FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="Green">Heading Tags:</FONT>Every documet starts with a heading.This tag is used to define different heading levels
in the HTML document.There are six heading levels(H1 to H6).H1 heading style displays the text in the largest size and is used for main heading.
The text increases to 24pt font size.The lowest level H6  reduces the font size to 8 pt size.The lower levels are used for sub headings and
less improtant things.It is not essential to use these heading levels in hierarchy.These heading tags are written within the < BODY> tag of the
document. 
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="Green"><B>Paragraph Tag</B></font>:Any text containing more than a few lines should be given inside the paragraph tags.The < p> tag offer a way to stucture the text into different
paragraphs.Each paragraph of text should be given between opening < p> and </ p> tags.A paragraph can be alinged using the attribute named "Aling".
Various attributes of a paragraph element as follow:
<p><FONT SIZE="3"COLOR="BLUE">Syntax</font><UL type="square"><LI><b>< p>:- Starts a new paragraph.
<LI>< P Align="Center">:- Aligns the text to the center <LI>< p Align="Right">:- Aligns the text to the right side.
<LI>< p Align="Left">:-Align the text to left side. <LI>< p Align="Justify">:- Aligns the text evenly between both left and right margins.</ul></b>
